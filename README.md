# spinifex_study

Within-subject user study comparing the radial tour (animation and steering basis), PCA (discretely jumping to two selected components), and the grand tour with random path (animate, no steering).

We test these visual factors across the experimental factors _location_ of the noise, _shape_ of the distributions and _dimension_-ality of the data.

In summary, using mixed modeling there is strong evidence that use of the radial tour leads to significant (and relatively large) improvement in our accuracy measure, especially with the location of signal is not mixed at 33/66%.


## Repository

This repository contains the code, app, ethics approval, data, analysis, and findings paper.

Tours are produced and saved with the [spinifex](https://github.com/nspyrison/spinifex) package.
