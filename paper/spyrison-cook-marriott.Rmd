# Hypothesis: 
# does the availability of the manual tour improve the ability of the analyst 
# to understand the importance of variables contributing to the structure?

# Factors: manual tour vs not (grand tour, or static only)
# Block/control: dimensionality p, n clusters, g, important vars d, var-covar s
# replication: 24 within-subject of all 3 factors, 4 controls, sampled from 
# datasets
# Randomization: latin square; 8 get each factor first.
# of those 8, 4 get one factor second, 4 get the other factor second.
# Response: Accuracy in determining important variable.
# measure: accuracy, speed (caped at 2min) ease of use, ease of understanding, ease of prefrence
