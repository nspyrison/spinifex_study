These manual controls complement the automatic views provided by a grand tour, or a guided tour, and give greatly improved flexibility to data analysts.},

The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to {GGobi}, or saved to disk.

This paper presents a novel method for generating such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the beneﬁt of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.},

The information encoded is increasingly explored using machine learning, but is not typically explored visually. The barrier tends to be visualising beyond 3D, but systematic approaches for this exist in the statistics literature. I use examples from particle and astrophysics to show how we can use the “grand tour” for such multidimensional visualisations, for example to explore grouping in high dimension and for visual identiﬁcation of multivariate outliers. I then discuss the idea of projection pursuit, i.e. searching the high-dimensional space for “interesting” low dimensional projections, and illustrate how we can detect complex associations between multiple parameters.},

The R package tourr provides functions for several types of tours: grand, guided, little, local and frozen. Each of these can be viewed dynamically, or saved into a data object for animation. This paper describes a new package, spinifex, which provides a manual tour of multivariate data where the projection coefﬁcient of a single variable is controlled. The variable is rotated fully into the projection, or completely out of the projection. The resulting sequence of projections can be displayed as an animation, with functions from either the plotly or gganimate packages. By varying the coefﬁcient of a single variable, it is possible to explore the sensitivity of structure in the projection to that variable. This is particularly useful when used with a projection pursuit guided tour to simplify and understand the solution. The use of the manual tour is applied particle physics data to illustrate the sensitivity of structure in a projection to speciﬁc variable contributions.},

Its interpretation is made extraordinarily difficult because it is not part of any formal system of statistical inference. As a result, the P value's inferential meaning is widely and often wildly misconstrued, a fact that has been pointed out in innumerable papers and books appearing since at least the 1940s. This commentary reviews a dozen of these common misinterpretations and explains why each is wrong. It also reviews the possible consequences of these improper understandings or representations of its meaning. Finally, it contrasts the P value with its Bayesian counterpart, the Bayes' factor, which has virtually all of the desirable properties of an evidential measure that the P value lacks, most notably interpretability. The most serious consequence of this array of P-value misconceptions is the false belief that the probability of a conclusion being in error can be calculated from the data in a single experiment without reference to external evidence or the plausibility of the underlying mechanism.},

	abstract = {Finite mixture models are being used increasingly to model a wide variety of random phenomena for clustering, classification and density estimation. mclust is a powerful and popular package which allows modelling of data as a Gaussian finite mixture with different covariance structures and different numbers of mixture components, for a variety of purposes of analysis. Recently, version 5 of the package has been made available on CRAN. This updated version adds new covariance structures, dimension reduction capabilities for visualisation, model selection criteria, initialisation strategies for the EM algorithm, and bootstrap-based inference, making it a full-featured R package for data analysis via finite mixture modelling.},

The 'spinifex' packages generates paths for manual tours by manipulating the contribution of a single variable at a time ['Cook' \& 'Buja' (1997) {\textless}doi:10.2307/1390747{\textgreater}]. Other types of tours, such as grand (random walk) and guided (optimizing some objective function) are available in the 'tourr' package ['Wickham' 'et' 'al.' (2011) {\textless}doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i02{\textgreater}]. 'spinifex' builds on 'tourr' and can render tours with 'gganimate' and 'plotly' graphics, and allows for exporting as an .html widget and as an .gif, respectively.
