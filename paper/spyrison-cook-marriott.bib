	abstract = {Most visualization techniques have traditionally used two-dimensional, instead of three-dimensional representations to visualize multidimensional and multivariate data. In this article, a way to demonstrate the underlying superiority of three-dimensional, with respect to two-dimensional, representation is proposed. Specifically, it is based on the inevitable quality degradation produced when reducing the data dimensionality. The problem is tackled from two different approaches: a visual and an analytical approach. First, a set of statistical tests (point classification, distance perception, and outlier identification) using the two-dimensional and three-dimensional visualization are carried out on a group of 40 users. The results indicate that there is an improvement in the accuracy introduced by the inclusion of a third dimension; however, these results do not allow to obtain definitive conclusions on the superiority of three-dimensional representation. Therefore, in order to draw further conclusions, a deeper study based on an analytical approach is proposed. The aim is to quantify the real loss of quality produced when the data are visualized in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces, in relation to the original data dimensionality, to analyze the difference between them. To achieve this, a recently proposed methodology is used. The results obtained by the analytical approach reported that the loss of quality reaches significantly high values only when switching from three-dimensional to two-dimensional representation. The considerable quality degradation suffered in the two-dimensional visualization strongly suggests the suitability of the third dimension to visualize data.},

Most indexes have been developed to detect departure from known distributions, such as normality, or to find separations between known groups. Here, we are interested in finding projections revealing potentially complex bivariate patterns, using new indexes constructed from scagnostics and a maximum information coefficient, with a purpose to detect unusual relationships between model parameters describing physics phenomena. The performance of these indexes is examined with respect to ideal behaviour, using simulated data, and then applied to problems from gravitational wave astronomy. The implementation builds upon the projection pursuit tools available in the R package, tourr, with indexes constructed from code in the R packages, scagnostics, minerva and mbgraphic.},

The data views are designed for data that have a multivariate component. The approach to displaying data comes from earlier research on building statistical graphics based on data pipelines, in which different aspects of data processing and graphical rendering are organized conceptually into segments of a pipeline. The software design takes advantage of the object-oriented nature of the Java language to open up the data pipeline, allowing developers to have greater control over their visualization applications. Importantly, new types of data views coded to adhere to a few simple design requirements can easily be integrated with existing pipe sections. This allows access to sophisticated linking and dynamic interaction across all (new and existing) view types. Pipe segments can be accessed from data analysis packages such as Omegahat or R, providing a tight coupling of visual and numerical methods.},

Using a screen input device such as a mouse, the analyst can specify, in a visual way, points or regions on the display and cause aspects of the display to change nearly instantaneously. Brushing is a collection of dynamic methods for viewing multidimensional data. It is very effective when used on a scatterplot matrix, a rectangular array of all pairwise scatterplots of the variables. Four brushing operations—highlight, shadow highlight, delete, and label—are carried out by moving a mouse-controlled rectangle, called the brush, over one of the scatterplots. The effect of an operation appears simultaneously on all scatterplots. Three paint modes—transient, lasting, and undo—and the ability to change the shape of the brush allow the analyst to specify collections of points on which the operations are carried out. Brushing can be used in various ways or on certain types of data; these usages are called brush techniques and include the following: single-point and cluster linking, conditioning on a single variable, conditioning on two variables, subsetting with categorical variables, and stationarity probing of a time series.},

	abstract = {Projection pursuit describes a procedure for searching high-dimensional data for “interesting” low-dimensional projections via the optimization of a criterion function called the projection pursuit index. By empirically examining the optimization process for several projection pursuit indexes, we observed differences in the types of structure that maximized each index. We were especially curious about differences between two indexes based on expansions in terms of orthogonal polynomials, the Legendre index, and the Hermite index. Being fast to compute, these indexes are ideally suited for dynamic graphics implementations. Both Legendre and Hermite indexes are weighted L 2 distances between the density of the projected data and a standard normal density. A general form for this type of index is introduced that encompasses both indexes. The form clarifies the effects of the weight function on the index's sensitivity to differences from normality, highlighting some conceptual problems with the Legendre and Hermite indexes. A new index, called the Natural Hermite index, which alleviates some of these problems, is introduced. A polynomial expansion of the data density reduces the form of the index to a sum of squares of the coefficients used in the expansion. This drew our attention to examining these coefficients as indexes in their own right. We found that the first two coefficients, and the lowest-order indexes produced by them, are the most useful ones for practical data exploration because they respond to structure that can be analytically identified, and because they have “long-sighted” vision that enables them to “see” large structure from a distance. Complementing this low-order behavior, the higher-order indexes are “short-sighted.” They are able to see intricate structure, but only when they are close to it. We also show some practical use of projection pursuit using the polynomial indexes, including a discovery of previously unseen structure in a set of telephone usage data, and two cautionary examples which illustrate that structure found is not always meaningful.},

	abstract = {This book is about using interactive and dynamic plots on a computer screen as part of data exploration and modeling, both alone and as a partner with static graphics and non-graphical computational methods. The area of int- active and dynamic data visualization emerged within statistics as part of research on exploratory data analysis in the late 1960s, and it remains an active subject of research today, as its use in practice continues to grow. It now makes substantial contributions within computer science as well, as part of the growing ?elds of information visualization and data mining, especially visual data mining. The material in this book includes: • An introduction to data visualization, explaining how it di?ers from other types of visualization. • Adescriptionofourtoolboxofinteractiveanddynamicgraphicalmethods. • An approach for exploring missing values in data. • An explanation of the use of these tools in cluster analysis and supervised classi?cation. • An overview of additional material available on the web. • A description of the data used in the analyses and exercises.

However, data mining strategies are often applied to massive data sets where visualization may not be very successful because of the limits of both screen resolution, human visual system resolution as well as the limits of available computational resources. In this paper I suggest some strategies for overcoming such limitations and illustrate visual data mining with some examples of successful attacks on high-dimensional and large data sets.

	abstract = {{SummaryIn} this paper, we present some graphical techniques for cluster analysis of high-dimensional data. Parallel coordinate plots and parallel coordinate density plots are graphical techniques which map multivariate data into a two-dimensional display. The method has some elegant duality properties with ordinary Cartesian plots so that higher-dimensional mathematical structures can be analyzed. Our high interaction software allows for rapid editing of data to remove outliers and isolate clusters by brushing. Our brushing techniques allow not only for hue adjustment, but also for saturation adjustment. Saturation adjustment allows for the handling of comparatively massive data sets by using the α-channel of the Silicon Graphics workstation to compensate for heavy overplotting.The grand tour is a generalized rotation of coordinate axes in a high-dimensional space. Coupled with the full-dimensional plots allowed by the parallel coordinate display, these techniques allow the data analyst to explore data which is both high-dimensional and massive in size. In this paper we give a description of both techniques and illustrate their use to do inverse regression and clustering. We have used these techniques to analyze data on the order of 250,000 observations in 8 dimensions. Because the analysis requires the use of color graphics, in the present paper we illustrate the methods with a more modest data set of 3848 observations. Other illustrations are available on our web page.},

The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to {GGobi}, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with diﬀerent, and new, approaches to tours of data. This paper contains animations that can be viewed using the Adobe Acrobat {PDF} viewer.},

	abstract = {Virtual environments are an emerging technology, which make use of 3-D display devices. Currently very little research into using this new technology for statistical graphics has been done. In association with the Iowa Center for Emerging Manufacturing Technology we have been building a statistical graphics application in the highly immersive C2 environment,called {VRGobi}. This paper describes an experiment conducted to determine if the new technology provides an improved exploratory data analysis environment over traditional workstation graphics environments, such as {XGobi}. A good analogy comparing the di erence between the two environments is that one is like a desk and the other like a room. The visualization tasks we compare between the two environments are detecting clusters, dimensionality and radial sparseness in high-dimensional data, and we also compare the ease of interaction between the computer and human user in the two environments.},

	abstract = {The use of novel displays and interaction resources to support immersive data visualization and improve analytical reasoning is a research trend in the information visualization community. In this work, we evaluate the use of an {HMD}-based environment for the exploration of multidimensional data, represented in 3D scatterplots as a result of dimensionality reduction ({DR}). We present a new modeling for this problem, accounting for the two factors whose interplay deter- mine the impact on the overall task performance: the difference in errors introduced by performing dimensionality reduction to 2D or 3D, and the difference in human perception errors under different visualization conditions. This two-step framework offers a simple approach to estimate the benefits of using an immersive 3D setup for a particular dataset. Here, the {DR} errors for a series of roll call voting datasets when using two or three dimensions are evaluated through an empirical task-based approach. The perception error and overall task performance, on the other hand, are assessed through a comparative user study with 30 participants. Results indicated that perception errors were low and similar in all approaches, resulting in overall performance benefits in both desktop and {HMD}-based 3D techniques. The immersive condition, however, was found to require less effort to find information and less navigation, besides providing much larger subjective perception of accuracy and engagement.},

To motivate discussion, requirements for the visualization of abstract data are reviewed and then related to the properties of immersive environments in order to show its potential for data visualization. This leads to the introduction of a novel concept for immersive visualization based on the involvement of the viewers into the data display. The usefulness of the concept is shown by two examples demonstrating that immersive environments are far more than tools to create visually appealing data representations.},

Projections can easily display aspects of structure that are only of low dimension, and sections–that is, intersections of subspaces with a high-dimensional object–can easily display structure of only low codimension (and hence often high dimension). However, compositions of sections and projections, here called prosections, can display aspects of structure of any intermediate dimension. These statements are relevant for data analysis: projections of data can be easily generated with x-y scatterplots, three-dimensional (3-D) data rotations, and grand tours; sections can be approximated in existing systems by scatterplot brushing and painting. Thus this article is in part an investigation into the principles underlying these techniques.},

This paper proposes three strategies for visualizing statistical models: (1) display the model in the data space, (2) look at all members of a collection, and (3) explore the process of model ﬁtting, not just the end result. Each strategy is accompanied by examples, including manova, classiﬁcation algorithms, hierarchical clustering, ensembles of linear models, projection pursuit, self organizing maps and neural networks.},

Traditionally, infovis has been concerned with discovering new relationships, and statistics with preventing spurious relationships from being reported. We pull these opposing poles closer with two new techniques for rigorous statistical inference of visual discoveries. The “Rorschach” helps the analyst calibrate their understanding of uncertainty and the “lineup” provides a protocol for assessing the signiﬁcance of visual discoveries, protecting against the discovery of spurious structure.},

	abstract = {A major problem in data analysis is to find any structure in a set of multivariate observations. If each observation is represented as a point in multidimensional space, this means finding the structure of a configuration of points in high-dimensional space. To find linear relationships among the variables, linear regression, principal components, and factor analysis are often used. One very simple and important kind of structure is clustering. Whenever the points cluster together, the knowledge of this is almost sure to be useful to the man who is interested in the data. Some structure-seeking methods depend on the distances between the points. For example, many cluster-seeking techniques look for collections of points whose interpoint distances are small in some sense. Similarly, the method of parametric mapping starts by calculating the matrix of interpoint distances of the original configuration and subsequently works only with that.},

	doi = {10.1117/12.172065},
	abstract = {Grand tours are a class of methods for visualizing multivariate data, or any finite set of points in n-space. The idea is to create an animation of data projections by moving a 2-dimensional projection plane through n-space. The path of planes used in the animation is chosen so that it becomes dense, that is, it comes arbitrarily close to any plane. One inspiration for the grand tour was the experience of trying to comprehend an abstract sculpture in a museum. One tends to walk around the sculpture, viewing it from many different angles. A useful class of grand tours is based on the idea of continuously interpolating an infinite sequence of randomly chosen planes. Visiting randomly (more precisely: uniformly) distributed planes guarantees denseness of the interpolating path. In computer implementations, 2-dimensional orthogonal projections are specified by two 1- dimensional projections which map to the horizontal and vertical screen dimensions, respectively. Hence, a grand tour is specified by a path of pairs of orthonormal projection vectors. This paper describes an interpolation scheme for smoothly connecting two pairs of orthonormal vectors, and thus for constructing interpolating grand tours. The scheme is optimal in the sense that connecting paths are geodesics in a natural Riemannian geometry.},
